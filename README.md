## About EDML
Event-Driven Machine Learning is an experiment ran by 
[@DivLoic](https://github.com/DivLoic) and [@Giulbia](https://github.com/giulbia).
The idea is to bring together all the components to build a system serving prediction in realtime.
From exploring the data with interactive tools like [Ai Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/) 
to deploying streaming application in the cloud with [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
the EDML project discuss the important points leading to model serving automation.
